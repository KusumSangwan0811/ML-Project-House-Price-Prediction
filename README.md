# ML Project on House Price Prediction

In this assignment, we predict the price of a house using relevant information and train multiple ML models and apply hyperparameter tuning on Random Forest to improve the models performance.

The Dataset used is available at House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition on Kaggle.

Step-by-step process:

1. Download and explore the data
2. Prepare the dataset for training
3. Train a linear regression model, make predictions and evaluate the model
4. Train, evaluate and interpret decision tree and random forest
5. Tune hyperparameters to improve the model
6. Make predictions and save the model


This is a project  that I have done in the course Machine Learning with Python: Zero to GBMs.
